# MenuBuster
*Beat Saber Plugin to disable VR controller system button when within a song*

**Only works with SteamVR**

This plugin disables the system button whenever you enter a song and reenables it when you leave. This is to make sure you don't open the SteamVR dashboard or take screenshots on accident.

**Note:** The plugin should work with Index, Vive, and Vive Cosmos. There have been [issues](https://github.com/rakso20000/MenuBuster/issues/1) with Oculus Link though.

## Installation
1) Download the [latest release](https://github.com/rakso20000/MenuBuster/releases/latest) of MenuBuster.
2) Put the contents of the zip into the Beat Saber directory.
